# 590V-project
Data Visualization Final Project

To run this project you must
1. First make sure the data folder contains the processed dataset (output.tsv).
2. If /data does not contain output.tsv then you must run the script columndelete.py to preprocess the dataset.
3. The script can be run by running the command "python columndelete.py" or "python3 columndelete.py" depending on your system configuration.
4. Once that is done, run the command "python -m http.server" and then navigate to 'localhost:8000' using the chrome web browser (this project is only guaranteed to work with chrome)
